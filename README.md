# time_series-forcasting

The project began with the collection and merging of data from two different sources. Preprocessing and data conversion methods were then applied, followed by a visual inspection to determine whether the series was stationary. This was done in order to select the correct forecasting model based on the data properties. The KPSS statistical model was then applied to ensure that the data was stationary, as the visual inspection was not clear enough. The data was then decomposed using seasonal decomposition to separate the trend and seasonality. This helped to understand the underlying statistical properties of the series and also helped to choose the correct forecasting model. The Holt Winters forecasting model was then applied to train the sales data and tested. The model achieved an accuracy of 80%, which is satisfactory. The model was then prepared for production and forecasting the sales of the next year.
